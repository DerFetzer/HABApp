_Easy automation with MQTT and/or openHAB_


HABApp is a asyncio/multithread application that connects to an openhab instance and/or a MQTT broker.
It is possible to create rules that listen to events from these instances and then react accordingly.

## Goals
The goal of this application is to provide a simple way to create home automation rules in python.
With full syntax highlighting and descriptive names it should almost never be required to look something up in the documentation
